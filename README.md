    - If you are prompted to sign in to your GitHub account to grant access to Gradescope, do so, and grant access to the COMP311 organization.

5. Your assignment should be autograded within a few seconds, and you will receive feedback.
6. If you receive all the points, then you have completed this assignment! Otherwise, you are free to keep pushing commits to your GitHub repository and resubmit for grading until the deadline.
